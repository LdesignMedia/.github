## 👋 About Ldesign Media

Ldesign Media is a specialist in LMS platform customization, with a strong focus on the Moodle™ software platform. We help organisations get the most out of their learning environment by extending Moodle with smart, robust and maintainable solutions, used by customers ranging from large enterprises and educational institutes to smaller organisations.

With over <b>18 years</b> of experience in software development and hundreds of Moodle plugins delivered, we know the platform inside out and understand what it means to run Moodle in production for real users.

## 💡 What we do

We focus on technical development around Moodle and related learning platforms:

- **Custom Moodle™ plugins & features**  
  New activity modules, blocks, local plugins and availability conditions that solve specific business or educational needs.

- **LMS customization & theming**  
  Tailoring the LMS to your organisation: UX, workflows, navigation, branding and configuration, while staying close to Moodle core for upgradeability.

- **Integrations & automation**  
  SSO, HR and SIS integrations, web services, background tasks and custom tooling to connect Moodle with the rest of your landscape.

- **Upgrades, refactors & plugin maintenance**  
  Modernising legacy plugins, making them compatible with newer Moodle releases and keeping them aligned with official coding standards.

- **Technical consultancy & code reviews**  
  Architecture advice, feasibility checks and second opinions on technical Moodle questions.

> We deliberately focus on the technical side — code, plugins, integrations, UX — not on didactics or content creation.

## 🎯 Why organisations choose Ldesign Media

- **Deep Moodle™ expertise**  
  Working with Moodle since version 1.8 and still going strong in the latest releases.

- **300+ plugins in the wild**  
  From small utility blocks to complete custom modules, we’ve built and maintained a large ecosystem of Moodle extensions.

- **Clean, maintainable code**  
  We follow Moodle’s coding standards and best practices so your customisations remain upgradable and sustainable.

- **Process & performance optimisation**  
  We don’t just “add features”; we help streamline processes so admins, teachers and learners actually gain time and clarity.

- **User-friendly interfaces**  
  Custom UI and UX that make complex functionality feel simple and intuitive.
